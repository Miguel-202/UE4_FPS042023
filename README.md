# FPS (Third-Person Shooter) Project
## Overview
This is a third-person shooter project developed in Unreal Engine, initially planned to be a first-person shooter. The project includes AI-controlled enemies, fire damage that spreads to the player, healing pickups, ammo pickups, animations, UI, menu system, win and lose conditions, set in a nature environment with rivers and trees. The bullets travel towards the hit marker on the UI, which dynamically changes color based on the damage type.

## Features
The following features have been implemented in this project using C++ in Unreal Engine:

Third-person camera view with character animations and movement<br>
AI behaviour for enemies, including pathfinding and attacking<br>
Fire damage that spreads to the player and enemies over time<br>
Healing pickups and ammo pickups to help the player<br>
UI with dynamic color changes based on damage type<br>
Menu system with win and lose conditions<br>
Nature environment with rivers and trees<br>
Bullets that travel towards the hit marker on the UI
## Technologies Used
This project was developed in Unreal Engine using C++ programming language. The project utilizes the following Unreal Engine features:

Animation Blueprint<br>
AI Behaviour Tree<br>
Blueprint Widgets<br>
Cascade Particle System<br>
